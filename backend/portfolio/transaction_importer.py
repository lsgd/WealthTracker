"""Shared transaction importer.

One place that turns broker ``TransactionInfo`` entries into ``Transaction`` rows,
idempotently. Used by the sync path after the balance snapshot, for every integration
that reports ``supports_transactions()``.

Dedup strategy (per account):
- Entries with a bank-side unique reference (camt.053 ``AcctSvcrRef``, a real MT940
  bank reference) get ``ref:<reference>`` as their key — exact, order-independent.
- Entries without one get a content hash over (booking date, amount, currency,
  counterparty, counterparty account, description) plus an *ordinal*: the occurrence
  index of that exact tuple within the fetched batch. Two identical coffee purchases
  on the same day therefore both survive, while re-importing an overlapping statement
  range maps them onto the same keys again. This relies on sources delivering whole
  booked days (camt.053 and MT940 statements do), so the ordinals are reproducible.
