# Changelog

## Next: 1.4.0

- Start screen now refreshes automatically after an automatic sync or after adding a snapshot from the account detail screen (no more pull-to-refresh needed)
- A "Syncing accounts" bar below the app bar now shows while a Sync All run is in progress, including automatic syncs on app open
- Sync results (synced count or per-account errors) are now also shown after automatic syncs
- Bug fixes and improvements.

## 1.3.8
- Added Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB) as a broker: accounts connect via EBICS and sync end-of-day balances. EBICS credentials are set up once on the web app (one-time key exchange) and shared across all your ZKB accounts.
- A ZKB account behaves like a manual account until its EBICS key exchange is activated by the bank: it prompts you to add snapshots by hand instead of showing a sync action that would fail.
- Bug fixes and improvements.

## Next: 1.3.7

- Bug fixes and improvements.

## 1.3.6

- Sync reminder can now repeat every day, every 3 days, weekly, or monthly (default every 3 days) instead of only daily
- New option to shift reminders that fall on a weekend to the next weekday, with an optional setting to also skip US market holidays (e.g. Good Friday, Christmas)
- Per-account chart y-axis now adapts to the visible value range with clean tick steps (100, 250, 500, 1k, 2.5k, 5k, 10k, ...)
- Per-account chart now loads the full snapshot history instead of just the most recent 100 entries
- Chart y-axis labels switch to 2 decimals (e.g. "13.20K", "1.25M") when step size would otherwise produce duplicate-looking ticks

## 1.3.5

- Stability improvements
- Tap an account card to view its history, balance chart, and full snapshot list

## 1.3.4

- Upgrade dependencies to the latest versions
- Quick snapshot sheet auto-closes after the last account is submitted
- 30-day chart range now forces daily granularity; previous setting restored when switching back
- Chart performance improved with downsampling for large datasets
- Y-axis labels always show 2 decimal places for million values
- Monthly aggregation method (last/min/max/avg) is now a user setting
- Sync no longer blocks the UI — graphs and manual data work while syncing
